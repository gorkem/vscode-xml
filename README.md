## Requirements

  * Java JDK (or JRE) 8 or more recent
  * Ensure Java path is set in either: 
    * `xml.java.home` in VSCode preferences
    * `java.home` in VSCode preferences
    * Environment variable `JAVA_HOME` or `JDK_HOME`  
    * **Note**: The path should end at the parent folder that contains the `bin` folder.  
      **Example Path**: `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0` if `bin` exists at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0/bin`.  
    * **Note**: If the path is not set, the extension will attempt to find the path to the JDK or JRE.
